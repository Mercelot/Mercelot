- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Mercelot
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in guitar, programming, video games, powerlifting, the sea, food and adventure!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a Junior PHP Information Systems Developer with experience in PHP (Symfony) & JavaScript (Vue). 2021 Focus is on building my PHP and JS skills for making full stack web applications. I am currently building my JavaScript knowledge and aspire to make node.js/express.js or PHP API's with HTML/CSS and vanilla JS or Vue.js front ends. In 2023 I will focus on C# for games and making back ends using Python to enhance my programming knowledge and increase my earning potential.
